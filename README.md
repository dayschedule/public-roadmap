# Product Roadmap

This roadmap contains all the issues, improvements and new features we plan for DaySchedule. Of course, things change and we may shuffle priorities at any time. At DaySchedule we learn a lot from talking to users, so don't hesitate to [contact us](https://dayschedule.com/contact) with your ideas and feedback.

**Note:** not all small updates and features will be tracked here, as we regularly make small updates based on private feedback or our own discoveries and we'd rather ship them than create and close issues here.
